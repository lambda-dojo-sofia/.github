# Lambda Dojo Sofia

The Lambda Dojo is a monthly meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, open to anybody with an interest in sharing and learning more about functional programming languages and techniques! Experienced software developer or an aspiring learner everybody is welcome!

The meetings will follow a semi standard, but informal format: we'll share stories of FP in production, news of FP in the wild and we'll code code code! Each meetup will have a Coding Dojo where we pair, have fun, get dirty, then show everybody how dirty exactly we got!
